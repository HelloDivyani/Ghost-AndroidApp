# Ghost-AndroidApp
It is an interesting Android Word Game App build in Applied Android With CS workshop.
In this an incomplete word(at least 4 letter) is given to user ,the user has to add one letter to word (inorder to make the word meaningful) but if 
the user completes the word then user looses the game and Computer wins the game.
The user can challenge the computer for checking if the word becomes meaningful.
After the user adds a meaningful letter the computer adds a string to new word to continue in path to progress.
